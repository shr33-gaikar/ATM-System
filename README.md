# Bank-ATM Management System

## Overview üìã
The Bank-ATM Management System is a Java-based application designed to simulate an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) interface. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to perform various banking operations such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, pin change, and mini statement generation.

## Features üöÄ
- **Balance Enquiry**: Check the available balance in the linked bank account.
- **Cash Withdrawal**: Withdraw cash from the linked bank account.
- **Deposit**: Deposit cash into the linked bank account.
- **Change PIN**: Change the PIN associated with the ATM card.
- **Fast Cash**: Perform quick cash withdrawals for predefined amounts.
- **Mini Statement**: View a summary of recent transactions.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality to access ATM features.
- **Transaction Logging**: Record all transactions for auditing purposes.
- **Connection Management**: Establish and manage connections with the bank server.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
Since the ATM Management System is a Java Swing application, you need to compile the source code and run the compiled Java bytecode (.class files). Here's how you can run the application:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shr33-gaikar/bank-atm-management-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd bank-atm-management-system
   ```
3. Compile the Java source files:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Run the main Java class:
   ```
   java MainLogin
   ```

## Usage üíª
Upon launching the Bank-ATM Management System, users can perform the following tasks:
- Log in to the system using their credentials.
- Navigate through the ATM interface to access various banking operations.
- Perform balance inquiries, cash withdrawals, deposits, pin changes, and mini statement requests.
- Receive prompts and notifications for successful or failed transactions.
- Log out securely from the system.
